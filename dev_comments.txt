1) I should refactor the models such that book is its own class.
# Allows data validation such that books actually exist, and book name can't be simply modified
# Book info really is static metadata, maybe should be configured by OPS team ? 
# Risk table is a timeseries, that has Book as foreign key

2) Adding of books maybe should be something configured on the admin section, e.g. something that has to through operations ??????

3)Maybe Copy to Today should be copying from the last business day to today ? 

4) I think I should refactor JS code to a separate file
